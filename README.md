# 2D-Ising-Model
The notebook simulates a 2D Ising Model with nearest neighbor interactions. A system of L x L square lattice with periodic boundary conditions is quenched using the Metrolpolis Algorithm. Observables such as the magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, energy and specific heat are also calculated.
